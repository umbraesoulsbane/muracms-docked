# Configuration Files

You may copy any of the following files in the container to /home/conf to make a local copy here that you can customize as needed. These will be copied from the local folder to the container at runtime.

- /usr/local/tomcat/conf/catalina.properties
- /usr/local/tomcat/conf/server.xml
- /usr/local/tomcat/conf/web.xml
- /opt/lucee/server/lucee-server/context/lucee-server.xml
- /opt/lucee/web/lucee-web.xml.cfm

Passwords for Lucee Admins are encrypted in the config files. Use the Web UI to update passwords before copying the files locally.
